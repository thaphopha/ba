Task:
You are an academic reviewer evaluating the Related Work chapter of a research paper.
Your goal is to assess the quality of the chapter according to the criteria below.

For each criterion:

Provide a numerical rating (1–10), where 1 = very poor and 10 = excellent.

Add a short justification (2–3 sentences).

At the end, calculate the average score and provide a final summary (5–7 sentences) that synthesizes your evaluation.

Evaluation Criteria:

Comprehensiveness (1–10):
How well does the chapter cover the breadth of relevant literature? Are important works included?

Relevance (1–10):
Are the cited works clearly related to the research problem? Does the chapter avoid irrelevant or tangential references?

Organization & Structure (1–10):
Is the literature grouped logically (e.g., by theme, method, or chronology)? Does the flow help the reader understand the research landscape?

Critical Analysis (1–10):
Does the author go beyond summarizing papers to compare, contrast, and highlight gaps or trends?

Clarity & Readability (1–10):
Is the writing clear, concise, and accessible? Does it avoid unnecessary jargon or confusion?

Citation Quality & Accuracy (1–10):
Are sources reliable, up-to-date, and cited correctly? Are key foundational and recent works included?

Final Steps:

Compute the average score across all criteria.

Write a final summary (5–7 sentences) highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and overall quality of the Related Work chapter.
