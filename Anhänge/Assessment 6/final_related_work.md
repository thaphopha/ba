## Related Works: Model Context Protocol (MCP)

### Introduction

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a pivotal standard for facilitating interaction between AI models and external tools, enabling seamless access to information and functionalities. This chapter synthesizes recent research on MCP, focusing on security, benchmarks and evaluation, integration and architecture, and applications. By comparing different approaches, results, and limitations, this chapter provides a critical overview of the current state of MCP research, identifies existing gaps, and highlights future research directions. This synthesis informs the present study by contextualizing its contributions within the broader MCP landscape and guiding its focus toward addressing identified limitations.

### Thematic Comparison of Relevant Literature

#### Security

Security is a prominent concern in MCP research. Radosevich & Halloran (2025) demonstrated significant security exploits in industry-leading LLMs using MCP, including malicious code execution and credential theft. Their work underscores the potential for LLMs to be coerced into compromising systems through MCP tools. Yang, Wu, & Chen (2025) further highlighted these vulnerabilities with MCPSecBench, revealing that over 85% of attacks successfully compromised multiple platforms, indicating core vulnerabilities affecting Claude, OpenAI, and Cursor. Hasan et al. (2025) identified tool poisoning vulnerabilities in a substantial percentage of MCP servers, while Fang et al. (2025) emphasized the safety risks introduced by malicious third-party MCP services.

In response to these threats, Kumar et al. (2025) presented MCP Guardian, a security framework that strengthens MCP-based communication through authentication, rate-limiting, and WAF scanning. Brett (2025) proposed a secure MCP Gateway architecture for enterprise AI integration, aiming to provide a robust security layer for MCP deployments. These contrasting approaches—identifying vulnerabilities versus proposing mitigation strategies—highlight the dual focus of security research in MCP.

#### Benchmarks and Evaluation

The development of benchmarks is crucial for assessing the performance and security of MCP-based systems. Yang, Wu, & Chen (2025) introduced MCPSecBench as a systematic security benchmark and playground for testing MCP implementations. This benchmark allows for standardized evaluation of security vulnerabilities across different platforms. Fan et al. (2025) contributed MCPToolBench++, a large-scale, multi-domain AI Agent tool use benchmark with over 4,000 MCP servers. These benchmarks provide valuable resources for evaluating the effectiveness of different MCP implementations and security measures.

#### Integration and Architecture

Research on MCP integration and architecture focuses on the components, workflow, and lifecycle of MCP systems. Hou et al. (2025) provided a comprehensive overview of MCP, analyzing its creation, operation, and update phases. Ahmadi, Sharif, & Banad (2025) presented MCP Bridge, a RESTful proxy that addresses limitations of direct MCP connections and enhances security. This proxy aims to facilitate seamless integration of MCP with existing systems.

#### Applications

The application of MCP in specific domains is also being explored. Chhetri et al. (2025) surveyed the use of MCP in adaptive transport systems, highlighting its ability to bridge protocol-level adaptation with context-aware decision-making. This application demonstrates the potential of MCP to enhance decision-making in complex systems.

### Critical Discussion of the Current State of the Art

The current state of MCP research reveals a rapidly evolving landscape. While significant progress has been made in identifying security vulnerabilities and developing benchmarks, several challenges remain. The research by Radosevich & Halloran (2025) and Yang, Wu, & Chen (2025) paints a concerning picture of the security risks associated with MCP, emphasizing the need for robust security measures. The development of MCP Guardian (Kumar et al., 2025) and the secure MCP Gateway architecture (Brett, 2025) represent important steps towards addressing these risks, but further research is needed to validate their effectiveness in real-world deployments.

The benchmarks developed by Yang, Wu, & Chen (2025) and Fan et al. (2025) provide valuable tools for evaluating MCP implementations, but these benchmarks are still relatively new, and their comprehensiveness and generalizability need to be further assessed. The architectural considerations discussed by Hou et al. (2025) and Ahmadi, Sharif, & Banad (2025) highlight the importance of seamless integration and efficient communication in MCP systems. The application of MCP in adaptive transport systems (Chhetri et al., 2025) demonstrates its potential in specific domains, but more research is needed to explore its applicability in other areas.

### Identification of Research Gaps

Several research gaps are evident in the literature. Hasan et al. (2025) highlighted the need for MCP-specific vulnerability detection techniques, as existing techniques may not be sufficient to identify the unique vulnerabilities associated with MCP. Fang et al. (2025) emphasized the need for research into mitigating third-party safety risks in MCP-powered agent systems, as these risks can be significant. Fan et al. (2025) addressed the lack of comprehensive evaluation datasets for MCP tool use, but further research is needed to expand and refine these datasets. Finally, more research is needed to analyze the security and performance of MCP in real-world deployments, particularly in enterprise environments.

### Conclusion

The research on MCP is rapidly evolving, with a strong focus on security, evaluation, and integration. The identified research gaps and emerging trends provide valuable directions for future research and development in this important area. As MCP continues to gain adoption, addressing these challenges will be crucial for ensuring the secure and sustainable development of AI-powered systems. The works highlighted in this chapter collectively inform the present study by underscoring the critical need for enhanced security measures and comprehensive evaluation frameworks in MCP. Future research should focus on developing MCP-specific vulnerability detection techniques, mitigating third-party safety risks, expanding evaluation datasets, and analyzing real-world deployments to ensure the secure and sustainable development of MCP-based AI systems.
