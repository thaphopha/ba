Feedback: This Related Work chapter provides a solid overview of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), focusing on key areas such as security, benchmarks, integration, and applications. The organization is logical, and the writing is clear. The chapter effectively identifies research gaps and suggests future directions. However, the reliance on a single year's worth of arXiv preprints limits its comprehensiveness and raises questions about whether earlier foundational work is being overlooked. To improve, the authors should broaden their search for relevant literature and provide more in-depth critical analysis of the cited works. Despite these limitations, the chapter provides a valuable context for the research paper.
