## 2.2 Thematic Review of AI in Healthcare Literature

This section organizes and compares the literature based on distinct thematic areas, providing a structured overview of the field.

### 2.2.1 General Overviews and Foundational Papers

Several foundational papers provide broad perspectives on the landscape of AI in healthcare. **Topol (2019)** emphasizes the transformative potential of AI, but also cautions against ethical, regulatory, and societal challenges. The author’s approach is future-oriented, painting a picture of the immense opportunities while recognizing potential pitfalls. A limitation of this overview is its broad scope, which prevents deep analysis into specific applications. **Jiang et al. (2017)** offer a historical context, tracing the evolution of AI in healthcare and projecting future trajectories. This historical analysis provides valuable context but lacks detailed discussion of cutting-edge techniques developed more recently.

### 2.2.2 AI in Medical Imaging

AI has revolutionized medical imaging, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. **Esteva et al. (2017)** demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning in detecting metastatic breast cancer, achieving performance on par with human pathologists. Their results showed that AI can perform at a level comparable to experts in a critical diagnostic task. However, the study is limited to a specific type of cancer and image modality. **O'Connell et al. (2022)** review various AI applications in radiology, noting the potential to streamline image analysis, diagnosis, and treatment planning. This review provides a good overview of the field but does not delve into the technical specifics of each application. **Raza and Rajpoot (2020)** focus on AI's role in digital pathology, particularly in automated image analysis for disease detection and grading. While they provide specific examples of AI applications, the lack empirical validation limits the scope of their findings.

### 2.2.3 Federated Learning for Privacy

Data privacy is a paramount concern in healthcare, driving the development of federated learning techniques. **Li et al. (2021)** present a comprehensive survey of federated learning techniques and their applications in healthcare, highlighting the role in preserving patient privacy. A limitation of the study is its survey nature, which is by definition limited in breadth, and therefore does not contain deep analysis. **Rieke et al. (2020)** explore the use of federated learning for healthcare informatics, enabling collaborative model training without sharing sensitive data. This article is limited by being an exploration of federated learning rather than a validation of its effectiveness through experimental results.

### 2.2.4 Explainable AI (XAI) in Healthcare

The need for transparency and interpretability in AI decision-making has led to the rise of Explainable AI (XAI). **Ras et al. (2022)** systematically review the current state of XAI in healthcare, highlighting the need for transparent and interpretable AI models to build trust and facilitate clinical adoption. The authors’ approach is highly structured, providing a taxonomy of XAI methods and their applications. A potential limitation is the rapidly evolving nature of XAI, which may render parts of the review quickly outdated.

### 2.2.5 AI in Specific Medical Domains

AI applications are increasingly tailored to specific medical domains, offering specialized solutions. **Attia et al. (2019)** review the applications of AI in cardiovascular medicine, including risk prediction, diagnosis, and treatment optimization. The scope of this review is limited to cardiovascular applications and does not cover AI's impact on other medical fields. **Paul et al. (2021)** discuss the use of machine learning in drug discovery, highlighting its potential to accelerate the identification of new drug candidates. This study's focus on drug discovery narrows its applicability to other healthcare applications. **Vaidyam et al. (2019)** provide a scoping review of AI in mental healthcare, covering applications such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and personalized interventions. The nature of a scoping review is limited in depth, and therefore, the conclusions drawn by the authors are appropriately tempered.

### 2.2.6 AI in Precision Medicine

AI plays a crucial role in tailoring treatment strategies to individual patient characteristics. **Libbrecht and Noble (2015)** discuss the role of AI in precision medicine, enabling personalized treatment strategies based on individual patient data. While the authors present a compelling vision for AI in precision medicine, the lack of empirical validation is a limitation.

### 2.2.7 AI and the Medical Internet of Things (MIoT)

The intersection of AI with connected medical devices offers opportunities for remote monitoring and data analysis. **Islam et al. (2020)** review the application of AI in the Medical Internet of Things, focusing on how AI can enhance remote monitoring and data analysis for improved healthcare delivery. Their study is limited by the rapidly evolving landscape of MIoT devices and AI algorithms, which may affect the currency of the review findings.

### 2.2.8 AI in Response to Pandemics

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the potential of AI in managing public health crises. **Abdulaal et al. (2021)** discuss the challenges and future directions of AI-enabled prediction of COVID-19 outcomes, highlighting the potential to improve patient management and resource allocation. The focus on COVID-19 limits the review’s generalizability to other pandemic situations.

## 2.3 Critical Discussion of the Current State of the Art

The studies reviewed demonstrate that AI is rapidly transforming various aspects of healthcare, from improving diagnostic accuracy in medical imaging to accelerating drug discovery and enabling personalized treatment strategies. Federated learning is emerging as a key technique for preserving patient privacy while enabling collaborative model training. Explainable AI is gaining importance as a means to build trust and facilitate clinical adoption of AI-driven solutions. Despite these advancements, several challenges remain. Ethical and regulatory frameworks are needed to govern the development and deployment of AI in healthcare. Data privacy and security concerns must be addressed to ensure the responsible use of patient data. Further research is needed to develop more generalizable and robust AI models, and to seamlessly integrate AI tools into clinical workflows.

## 2.4 Identified Research Gaps
