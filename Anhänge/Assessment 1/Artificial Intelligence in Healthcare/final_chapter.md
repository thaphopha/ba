However, the study is limited to a specific type of cancer and image modality, raising concerns about generalizability to other cancers or imaging techniques. Furthermore, the dataset used may contain biases that could affect the model's performance in real-world clinical settings. **O'Connell et al. (2022)** review various AI applications in radiology, noting the potential to streamline image analysis, diagnosis, and treatment planning. While this review provides a good overview of the field, it does not delve into the technical specifics of each application, making it difficult for researchers to identify promising areas for further investigation. **Raza and Rajpoot (2020)** focus on AI's role in digital pathology, particularly in automated image analysis for disease detection and grading. As a review article, it synthesizes existing research but does not present new empirical validation, highlighting the need for further primary studies in this area.

### 2.2.3 Federated Learning for Privacy

Data privacy is a paramount concern in healthcare, driving the development of federated learning techniques. **Li et al. (2021)** present a comprehensive survey of federated learning techniques and their applications in healthcare, highlighting their role in preserving patient privacy. While the survey offers a broad overview, the heterogeneity of data and communication costs in healthcare settings pose specific challenges that warrant further investigation. **Rieke et al. (2020)** explore the use of federated learning for healthcare informatics, enabling collaborative model training without sharing sensitive data. This article is limited by being an exploration of federated learning rather than a validation of its effectiveness through experimental results, thus the practical benefits need more studies.

### 2.2.4 Explainable AI (XAI) in Healthcare

The need for transparency and interpretability in AI decision-making has led to the rise of Explainable AI (XAI). **Ras et al. (2022)** systematically review the current state of XAI in healthcare, highlighting the need for transparent and interpretable AI models to build trust and facilitate clinical adoption. The authors’ highly structured approach provides a taxonomy of XAI methods and their applications. A potential limitation is the rapidly evolving nature of XAI, which may render parts of the review quickly outdated. For example, techniques like SHAP and LIME are widely used, but their computational complexity and potential instability in certain contexts remain challenges.

AI applications are increasingly tailored to specific medical domains, offering specialized solutions. **Attia et al. (2019)** review the applications of AI in cardiovascular medicine, including risk prediction, diagnosis, and treatment optimization. The scope of this review is limited to cardiovascular applications and does not cover AI's impact on other medical fields, such as oncology or neurology, where AI is also making significant strides. **Paul et al. (2021)** discuss the use of machine learning in drug discovery, highlighting its potential to accelerate the identification of new drug candidates. This study's focus on drug discovery narrows its applicability to other healthcare applications, such as diagnostics or personalized medicine. **Vaidyam et al. (2019)** provide a scoping review of AI in mental healthcare, covering applications such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and personalized interventions. The nature of a scoping review is limited in depth, and therefore, the conclusions drawn by the authors are appropriately tempered.

Across these diverse medical domains, a key trend is the increasing integration of AI with real-world clinical data to develop personalized and predictive models. However, challenges remain in ensuring the reliability and generalizability of these models, as well as addressing ethical and regulatory concerns related to their deployment.

### 2.2.6 AI in Precision Medicine

AI plays a crucial role in tailoring treatment strategies to individual patient characteristics. **Libbrecht and Noble (2015)** discuss the role of AI in precision medicine, enabling personalized treatment strategies based on individual patient data. While the authors present a compelling vision for AI in precision medicine, the lack of empirical validation is a limitation. The implementation of AI in precision medicine requires vast amounts of high-quality data, as well as sophisticated computational infrastructure and expertise, which can be challenging to acquire and maintain.

### 2.2.7 AI and the Medical Internet of Things (MIoT)

The intersection of AI with connected medical devices offers opportunities for remote monitoring and data analysis. **Islam et al. (2020)** review the application of AI in the Medical Internet of Things, focusing on how AI can enhance remote monitoring and data analysis for improved healthcare delivery. Their study is limited by the rapidly evolving landscape of MIoT devices and AI algorithms, which may affect the currency of the review findings. Specifically, security and privacy risks associated with MIoT devices, such as data breaches and unauthorized access, require robust AI-powered security solutions.

### 2.2.8 AI in Response to Pandemics

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the potential of AI in managing public health crises. **Abdulaal et al. (2021)** discuss the challenges and future directions of AI-enabled prediction of COVID-19 outcomes, highlighting the potential to improve patient management and resource allocation. The focus on COVID-19 limits the review’s generalizability to other pandemic situations. Lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the importance of real-time data analysis and predictive modeling, can be applied to improve future pandemic responses and strengthen public health infrastructure.

## 2.3 Critical Discussion of the Current State of the Art
