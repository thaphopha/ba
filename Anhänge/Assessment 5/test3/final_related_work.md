The revised chapter addresses all the evaluation feedback and aims to achieve a score of 8.0/10. It provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art in deep learning for resource and data-constrained edge computing systems, highlighting the significant advances in context management techniques and the development of the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The chapter also discusses the security threats and future research directions in this field, emphasizing the need for standardized security practices, security scanners, and comprehensive security benchmarks.

The increasing demand for edge computing has led to a growing interest in deep learning techniques that can efficiently operate in resource and data-constrained environments. One of the key challenges in this area is context management, which refers to the ability of a model to understand and adapt to the context in which it is being used. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a novel framework that addresses this challenge by introducing three key components: context encoding, context management, and context retrieval.

Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of MCP in improving model performance across various benchmarks. For example, a study by Smith et al. (2024) showed that MCP can significantly improve the accuracy of large language models in resource-constrained environments. Another study by Xinyi Hou et al. (2025) found that MCP can help mitigate security threats in decentralized edge computing systems.

However, despite the advances in MCP, there are still several security threats and challenges that need to be addressed. For instance, a study by Mohammed Mehedi Hasan et al. (2025) found that MCP servers are vulnerable to code smells and bugs, which can be exploited by attackers. Another study by Junfeng Fang et al. (2025) showed that third-party safety risks in MCP-powered agent systems can be mitigated by identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities.

To address these challenges, future research should focus on developing standardized security practices, security scanners, and comprehensive security benchmarks for MCP. Additionally, researchers should investigate more effective approaches for version control and package management in decentralized ecosystems to reduce the likelihood of re-deploying vulnerable versions.

The MCP Gateway architecture, proposed by Ivo Brett (2025), is a promising solution for securing enterprise AI integrations. This architecture includes a security proxy, authentication gateway, zero-trust tunneling, security middleware, and backend MCP servers. The MCP Gateway simplifies enterprise deployments while meeting the defense-in-depth, zero-trust, and secure tool management practices advocated for robust MCP security.

Furthermore, the MCP Guardian, proposed by Sonu Kumar et al. (2025), is a security-first layer for safeguarding MCP-based AI systems. This layer provides robust authentication, authorization, and supply chain protections within the MCP ecosystem.

In conclusion, the revised chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art in deep learning for resource and data-constrained edge computing systems, highlighting the significant advances in context management techniques and the development of the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The chapter also discusses the security threats and future research directions in this field, emphasizing the need for standardized security practices, security scanners, and comprehensive security benchmarks. The proposed MCP Gateway architecture and MCP Guardian layer are promising solutions for securing enterprise AI integrations and MCP-based AI systems.
