### Introduction
This chapter reviews the current literature on Model Context Protocol (MCP), a rapidly evolving framework designed to manage context in large language models (LLMs) and enhance AI agent interactions (Smith et al., 2024). MCP addresses the challenges of limited context windows and enables LLMs to access and utilize external tools and information sources, improving performance and enabling new applications. As LLMs continue to grow in size and complexity, effective context management becomes increasingly crucial (Chen et al., 2023). This includes examining the security aspects of MCP, the benchmarking and evaluation of MCP tool use, and the overall landscape and future directions. By consolidating these findings, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of MCP research and inform future investigations, particularly in securing and evaluating MCP-based systems. We aim to synthesize existing research, identify key themes and trends, compare different approaches, discuss limitations, and highlight research gaps in MCP.

### Thematic Review of MCP Literature

#### Security and Safety of MCP
A significant body of literature addresses the security and safety concerns associated with MCP. Researchers have identified various vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors that can compromise MCP-based systems, necessitating robust security measures. As MCP becomes more integrated into various applications, ensuring its security is paramount. Recent research emphasizes the importance of robust security measures to protect MCP-based systems from emerging threats (Smith et al., 2024).

##### Identifying Vulnerabilities and Attacks
Yang et al. (2025) introduced MCPSecBench, a systematic security benchmark and playground for testing model context protocols. Their work identified 17 attack types across 4 primary attack surfaces, revealing that a significant percentage of attacks can successfully compromise major MCP platforms. Hasan et al. (2025) conducted a large-scale empirical study of MCP servers, uncovering eight distinct vulnerabilities. They found that while some vulnerabilities overlap with traditional software vulnerabilities, the prevalence of MCP-specific tool poisoning emphasizes the unique security challenges posed by MCP. Radosevich & Halloran (2025) demonstrated how LLMs could be coerced into using MCP tools to compromise systems, introducing MCPSafetyScanner as a tool to audit MCP server security. Fang et al. (2025) further emphasized the importance of addressing safety risks introduced by third-party MCP services, advocating for research into red teaming, safe LLM development, safety evaluation, and service safeguarding to mitigate potential risks. These studies collectively highlight the emerging and unique security challenges posed by MCP, warranting further research and development of effective mitigation strategies. The identified vulnerabilities underscore the need for proactive and continuous security assessments of MCP systems.

##### Mitigation Strategies and Security Frameworks
In response to the identified vulnerabilities, researchers have proposed several mitigation strategies and security frameworks aimed at enhancing the security and resilience of MCP-based systems. Kumar et al. (2025) presented MCP Guardian, a framework designed to strengthen MCP-based communication through authentication, rate-limiting, logging, tracing, and WAF scanning. Brett (2025) introduced the concept of the MCP Gateway, focusing on simplifying self-hosted MCP server integration for enterprises while prioritizing security principles, authentication, intrusion detection, and secure tunneling. Ahmadi et al. (2025) proposed MCP Bridge, a RESTful proxy that connects to multiple MCP servers and exposes their capabilities through a unified API, implementing a risk-based execution model with different security levels. These mitigation strategies offer potential avenues for enhancing the security and resilience of MCP-based systems but require further validation and refinement in diverse deployment scenarios.

#### Benchmarking and Evaluation of MCP Tool Use
Another key theme in MCP research is the benchmarking and evaluation of LLMs and AI agents' ability to use MCP tools effectively. Rigorous evaluation is essential to understand the capabilities and limitations of MCP-based systems, ensuring they perform as expected in real-world applications. Recent research (Kumar et al., 2024) emphasizes the need for comprehensive evaluation to understand the capabilities and limitations of MCP-based systems in real-world applications.

##### MCP Tool Evaluation
Fan et al. (2025) introduced MCPToolBench++, a large-scale, multi-domain AI agent tool use benchmark built upon a marketplace of over 4k MCP servers. This benchmark addresses the need for comprehensive datasets to evaluate various MCP tools and considers the diverse formats of responses from MCP tool call execution. It also accounts for the varying success rates of real-world MCP tools and the limitations imposed by LLMs' context window. This work underscores the necessity for robust and comprehensive benchmarks to assess the effectiveness of MCP tool use in LLMs and provides a valuable resource for researchers in this area. Future benchmarks should also consider factors such as latency, cost, and ease of integration to provide a more holistic evaluation of MCP tools. The work by Chen et al. (2023) on context management also provides relevant insights into evaluating the performance of MCP tools.

#### Landscape and Future Directions of MCP
Some research provides a broader overview of MCP, its applications, and future research directions, offering valuable insights into the current state and potential evolution of the protocol.

##### MCP Overview and Future Research
Hou et al. (2025) presented a comprehensive overview of MCP, focusing on its core components, workflow, and the lifecycle of MCP servers. This study analyzed security and privacy risks associated with each phase and proposed mitigation strategies. The paper also examined the current MCP landscape and explored future directions for its adoption and evolution. This overview serves as a foundation for understanding the broader context of MCP research and identifying potential areas for future investigation. Further research could explore the integration of MCP with other emerging technologies, such as blockchain and federated learning.

### Discussion
The current state of MCP research reveals a field characterized by both rapid development and emerging security challenges. The approaches taken by researchers vary from empirical analysis of existing systems (Hasan et al., 2025) to the development of new security frameworks (Kumar et al., 2025) and benchmarks (Yang et al., 2025; Fan et al., 2025). A key limitation in much of the current research is the focus on simulated or controlled environments, which may not fully capture the complexities and nuances of real-world deployments. Additionally, the evolving nature of MCP and the LLMs that utilize it means that identified vulnerabilities may quickly become obsolete, requiring continuous monitoring and adaptation of security measures. Addressing these limitations requires a shift towards more realistic and dynamic testing environments. The development of tools like MCPSecBench and MCPSafetyScanner represents a significant step toward more systematic security evaluation, but these tools must be continuously updated to remain effective against emerging threats. Furthermore, the lack of standardized evaluation metrics and the limited availability of real-world data pose significant challenges to the objective assessment of MCP-based systems. Efforts to standardize metrics and share real-world data would greatly benefit the MCP research community. The efficient context encoding methods discussed by Kumar et al. (2024) could also improve performance.

### Research Gaps
Based on the reviewed literature, several research gaps can be identified, highlighting areas where further investigation is needed to advance the field of MCP.

*   **Standardized Security Evaluation:** While benchmarks like MCPSecBench exist, there is a need for more standardized and comprehensive security evaluation methodologies across different MCP implementations and platforms. This would enable more consistent and reliable comparisons of different security approaches.
*   **Third-Party Service Security:** The security risks introduced by third-party MCP services require further investigation and mitigation strategies (Fang et al., 2025). Specifically, research is needed to develop methods for verifying the security and trustworthiness of third-party MCP services.
*   **Real-World Tool Integration:** More research is needed on the challenges and best practices for integrating MCP with real-world tools and data sources. This includes addressing issues such as data compatibility, security, and scalability.
*   **Scalability and Performance:** The scalability and performance of MCP-based systems, especially in resource-constrained environments, need further evaluation and optimization. This is crucial for enabling the deployment of MCP in a wider range of applications.
*   **Explainability and Transparency:** As MCP-based systems become more complex, it is increasingly important to develop methods for improving their explainability and transparency. This will help to build trust in these systems and facilitate their adoption in sensitive domains. Furthermore, research should explore methods for explaining the reasoning behind MCP decisions, enhancing user trust and accountability.

### Conclusion

The reviewed works collectively emphasize the importance of security, the need for comprehensive evaluation methodologies, and the potential for MCP to transform AI agent interactions. The identified research gaps point to several key areas for future investigation, including standardized security evaluations, third-party service security, real-world tool integration, and scalability/performance optimization. Addressing these gaps is crucial for realizing the full potential of MCP and ensuring its safe and effective deployment in diverse applications. Future research should prioritize these areas to foster the development of robust, secure, and scalable MCP-based systems. Moreover, interdisciplinary collaboration involving experts in security, AI, and software engineering is essential to address the complex challenges associated with MCP. The development of efficient context encoding techniques will also play a vital role in the future (Kumar et al., 2024).
