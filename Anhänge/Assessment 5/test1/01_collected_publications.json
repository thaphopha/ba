    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly augmented with external tools\nthrough standardized interfaces like the Model Context Protocol (MCP). However,\ncurrent MCP implementations face critical limitations: they typically require\nlocal process execution through STDIO transports, making them impractical for\nresource-constrained environments like mobile devices, web browsers, and edge\ncomputing. We present MCP Bridge, a lightweight RESTful proxy that connects to\nmultiple MCP servers and exposes their capabilities through a unified API.\nUnlike existing solutions, MCP Bridge is fully LLM-agnostic, supporting any\nbackend regardless of vendor. The system implements a risk-based execution\nmodel with three security levels standard execution, confirmation workflow, and\nDocker isolation while maintaining backward compatibility with standard MCP\nclients. Complementing this server-side infrastructure is a Python based MCP\nGemini Agent that facilitates natural language interaction with MCP tools. The\nevaluation demonstrates that MCP Bridge successfully addresses the constraints\nof direct MCP connections while providing enhanced security controls and\ncross-platform compatibility, enabling sophisticated LLM-powered applications\nin previously inaccessible environments",

While MCP\nenhances the capabilities of LLM-based agents, it also introduces new security\nrisks and expands their attack surfaces. In this paper, we present the first\nsystematic taxonomy of MCP security, identifying 17 attack types across 4\nprimary attack surfaces. We introduce MCPSecBench, a comprehensive security\nbenchmark and playground that integrates prompt datasets, MCP servers, MCP\nclients, and attack scripts to evaluate these attacks across three major MCP\nproviders. Our benchmark is modular and extensible, allowing researchers to\nincorporate custom implementations of clients, servers, and transport protocols\nfor systematic security assessment. Experimental results show that over 85% of\nthe identified attacks successfully compromise at least one platform, with core\nvulnerabilities universally affecting Claude, OpenAI, and Cursor, while\nprompt-based and tool-centric attacks exhibit considerable variability across\ndifferent hosts and models. Overall, MCPSecBench standardizes the evaluation of\nMCP security and enables rigorous testing across all MCP layers.",

    "summary": "LLMs' capabilities are enhanced by using function calls to integrate various\ndata sources or API results into the context window. Typical tools include\nsearch, web crawlers, maps, financial data, file systems, and browser usage,\netc. Integrating these data sources or functions requires a standardized\nmethod. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way to supply\ncontext to LLMs. However, the evaluation of LLMs and AI Agents' MCP tool use\nabilities suffer from several issues. First, there's a lack of comprehensive\ndatasets or benchmarks to evaluate various MCP tools. Second, the diverse\nformats of response from MCP tool call execution further increase the\ndifficulty of evaluation. Additionally, unlike existing tool-use benchmarks\nwith high success rates in functions like programming and math functions, the\nsuccess rate of real-world MCP tool is not guaranteed and varies across\ndifferent MCP servers. Furthermore, the LLMs' context window also limits the\nnumber of available tools that can be called in a single run, because the\ntextual descriptions of tool and the parameters have long token length for an\nLLM to process all at once. To help address the challenges of evaluating LLMs'\nperformance on calling MCP tools, we propose MCPToolBench++, a large-scale,\nmulti-domain AI Agent tool use benchmark. As of July 2025, this benchmark is\nbuild upon marketplace of over 4k MCP servers from more than 40 categories,\ncollected from the MCP marketplaces and GitHub communities.

    "summary": "To reduce development overhead and enable seamless integration between\npotential components comprising any given generative AI application, the Model\nContext Protocol (MCP) (Anthropic, 2024) has recently been released and\nsubsequently widely adopted. The MCP is an open protocol that standardizes API\ncalls to large language models (LLMs), data sources, and agentic tools. By\nconnecting multiple MCP servers, each defined with a set of tools, resources,\nand prompts, users are able to define automated workflows fully driven by LLMs.\nHowever, we show that the current MCP design carries a wide range of security\nrisks for end users. In particular, we demonstrate that industry-leading LLMs\nmay be coerced into using MCP tools to compromise an AI developer's system\nthrough various attacks, such as malicious code execution, remote access\ncontrol, and credential theft. To proactively mitigate these and related\nattacks, we introduce a safety auditing tool, MCPSafetyScanner, the first\nagentic tool to assess the security of an arbitrary MCP server. MCPScanner uses\nseveral agents to (a) automatically determine adversarial samples given an MCP\nserver's tools and resources; (b) search for related vulnerabilities and\nremediations based on those samples; and (c) generate a security report\ndetailing all findings. Our work highlights serious security issues with\ngeneral-purpose agentic workflows while also providing a proactive tool to\naudit MCP server safety and address detected vulnerabilities before deployment.\n  The described MCP server auditing tool, MCPSafetyScanner, is freely available\nat: https://github.com/johnhalloran321/mcpSafetyScanner",

    "summary": "The development of large language models (LLMs) has entered in a\nexperience-driven era, flagged by the emergence of environment feedback-driven\nlearning via reinforcement learning and tool-using agents. This encourages the\nemergence of model context protocol (MCP), which defines the standard on how\nshould a LLM interact with external services, such as \\api and data. However,\nas MCP becomes the de facto standard for LLM agent systems, it also introduces\nnew safety risks.

These third-party\nMCP services provider are potentially malicious and have the economic\nincentives to exploit vulnerabilities and sabotage user-agent interactions. In\nthis position paper, we advocate the research community in LLM safety to pay\nclose attention to the new safety risks issues introduced by MCP, and develop\nnew techniques to build safe MCP-powered agent systems. To establish our\nposition, we argue with three key parts. (1) We first construct \\framework, a\ncontrolled framework to examine safety issues in MCP-powered agent systems. (2)\nWe then conduct a series of pilot experiments to demonstrate the safety risks\nin MCP-powered agent systems is a real threat and its defense is not trivial.\n(3) Finally, we give our outlook by showing a roadmap to build safe MCP-powered\nagent systems.

Unlike mature software ecosystems with\nrigorous vetting, MCP servers still lack standardized review mechanisms, giving\nadversaries opportunities to distribute malicious implementations. Despite this\npressing risk, the security implications of MCP servers remain underexplored.\nTo address this gap, we present the first systematic study that treats MCP\nservers as active threat actors and decomposes them into core components to\nexamine how adversarial developers can implant malicious intent. Specifically,\nwe investigate three research questions: (i) what types of attacks malicious\nMCP servers can launch, (ii) how vulnerable MCP hosts and Large Language Models\n(LLMs) are to these attacks, and (iii) how feasible it is to carry out MCP\nserver attacks in practice. Our study proposes a component-based taxonomy\ncomprising twelve attack categories. For each category, we develop\nProof-of-Concept (PoC) servers and demonstrate their effectiveness across\ndiverse real-world host-LLM settings. We further show that attackers can\ngenerate large numbers of malicious servers at virtually no cost. We then test\nstate-of-the-art scanners on the generated servers and found that existing\ndetection approaches are insufficient. These findings highlight that malicious\nMCP servers are easy to implement, difficult to detect with current tools, and\ncapable of causing concrete damage to AI agent systems.

To address this gap, we present the MCP Attack Library\n(MCPLIB), which categorizes and implements 31 distinct attack methods under\nfour key classifications: direct tool injection, indirect tool injection,\nmalicious user attacks, and LLM inherent attack. We further conduct a\nquantitative analysis of the efficacy of each attack. Our experiments reveal\nkey insights into MCP vulnerabilities, including agents' blind reliance on tool\ndescriptions, sensitivity to file-based attacks, chain attacks exploiting\nshared context, and difficulty distinguishing external data from executable\ncommands. These insights, validated through attack experiments, underscore the\nurgency for robust defense strategies and informed MCP design. Our\ncontributions include 1) constructing a comprehensive MCP attack taxonomy, 2)\nintroducing a unified attack framework MCPLIB, and 3) conducting empirical\nvulnerability analysis to enhance MCP security mechanisms. This work provides a\nfoundational framework, supporting the secure evolution of MCP ecosystems.",
