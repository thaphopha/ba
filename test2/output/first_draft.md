AI has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in diagnosing various diseases, often achieving accuracy comparable to or exceeding that of human experts. Esteva et al. (2017) developed a deep learning algorithm for identifying metastatic breast cancer in histopathology images, achieving high accuracy. Similarly, Gulshan et al. (2016) created a deep learning algorithm for detecting diabetic retinopathy in retinal fundus photographs, showing comparable performance to ophthalmologists. Hannun et al. (2019) demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning in detecting atrial fibrillation from single-lead ECG recordings. While these studies showcase the potential of AI in diagnostics, the limitations include the need for large, high-quality datasets for training, and the challenge of generalizing the models to diverse patient populations.

## Predictive Modeling

AI can be used to predict patient outcomes, enabling proactive interventions and personalized treatment strategies. Mortazavi et al. (2018) used AI to predict heart failure and mortality in a community-based cohort, demonstrating the potential for identifying high-risk individuals. Predictive modeling applications can help in optimizing resource allocation, improving patient care, and reducing healthcare costs. The limitations include the risk of overfitting the models to specific datasets and the need for continuous monitoring and recalibration to maintain accuracy over time.

## Specific Healthcare Domains
